# MeanFlow
üòà This repository offers an **unofficial PyTorch implementation** of the paper [_Mean Flows for One-step Generative Modeling_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13447), building upon [Just-a-DiT](https://github.com/ArchiMickey/Just-a-DiT) and [EzAudio](https://github.com/haidog-yaqub/EzAudio).

## Examples
**MNIST** -- 10k training steps, single-step sample result:

## TODO
- [x] Implement basic training and inference
- [x] Enable multi-GPU training via ü§ó Accelerate
- [ ] Add support for Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) [WIP]
- [ ] Integrate latent image representation support
- [ ] Deploy interactive demo on Hugging Face Spaces
- [ ] Extend to additional modalities (e.g., audio, speech)
- [ ] Explore integration with pre-trained models (e.g., ControlNet, LoRA)

## Known Issues (PyTorch)
- `jvp` is incompatible with Flash Attention and likely also with Triton, Mamba, and similar libraries.  
- `jvp` significantly increases GPU memory usage, even when using `torch.utils.checkpoint`.
